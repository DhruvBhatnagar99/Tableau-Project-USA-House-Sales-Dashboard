### Project Overview: House Sales in USA
This project focuses on analyzing the "House Sales" dataset, which contains comprehensive information about property sales. Through data analysis and visualization, I have uncovered trends and factors impacting house prices. Key objectives include identifying influential features like Price, Bedrooms, Square foot living, Condition, and Year_built for understanding sales variations over time. The project offers insights valuable to real estate professionals, investors, and enthusiasts.
